HOW TO PLAY:
This is fun game.The player wins if your score is >=50.
Basically,This game consist of two players.we need to click roll dice button then random number will been displayed.Then the current displayed number is added to current score unit you hold your current score by clicking on the hold button.Then game switches to player 2,then player keeps playing but,If random number displayed 1 then your current score destroyes and you can't add to current score.When Dice 1 is displayed the automatically the player switch to other player.If holding score is >=50 then the active player will be declared as won.Then again we need to reset the game by clicking on again button then player 1 will be active player.

Hence this helped me very much to upgrade my skills in javascript.
